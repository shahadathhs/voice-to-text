SPEAKER_63: The Secret to Write To The Great Sentence
SPEAKER_34: Today, we will talk about a very interesting story
SPEAKER_34: that people say is a very interesting story.
SPEAKER_34: But I think it's a good story.
SPEAKER_34: It's a very interesting story that people want to watch.
SPEAKER_45: But I don't think it's too hard to find.
SPEAKER_07: People want to change their own story,
SPEAKER_07: or feel that they are not good enough for the story or the story they want to talk about.
SPEAKER_47: It's true.
SPEAKER_59: But I think it's a good story.
SPEAKER_79: If we are a very good person,
SPEAKER_36: we can be very happy and happy.
SPEAKER_67: But this story is okay.
SPEAKER_36: It's not that the story is a good story.
SPEAKER_65: The problem is that people have the same opinion.
SPEAKER_14: There are no people who are doing the same thing or are suffering.
SPEAKER_14: People don't follow the trend.
SPEAKER_57: But this is not a good thing.
SPEAKER_07: And the first thing that comes to mind is that
SPEAKER_14: the most beautiful thing is that there is only one thing.
SPEAKER_30: The truth is that people are so excited to go to work.
SPEAKER_30: They think that the work is so difficult.
SPEAKER_46: They don't have to worry, think, think, or go to work.
SPEAKER_71: Yes.
SPEAKER_84: I think the truth is that people who are interested in themselves
SPEAKER_48: can accept themselves.
SPEAKER_74: And if there are many things that people are interested in,
SPEAKER_75: everyone has their own happiness.
SPEAKER_87: The truth is that you can't understand
SPEAKER_18: the meaning of the truth.
SPEAKER_76: But if you don't accept the love of love,
SPEAKER_18: you have to be very serious.
SPEAKER_33: And this is what we want to show people
SPEAKER_33: that we are trying to understand.
SPEAKER_33: And now, we have to find the truth in the story.
SPEAKER_09: It's true to yourself to one idea capsule per sentence.
SPEAKER_23: When your sentence becomes too long,
SPEAKER_04: it is sensible to break it up into more sentences
SPEAKER_51: with fewer clauses.
SPEAKER_04: No sentence should contain more than three clauses,
SPEAKER_04: since the sides distract the reader from the original point.
SPEAKER_04: Single clause sentences are the most effective
SPEAKER_05: at focusing attention.
SPEAKER_61: You could consider it unfair on your reader
SPEAKER_06: if he or she has to search for meaning in your writing.
SPEAKER_50: Communication with the reader will be at its best
SPEAKER_05: if your style is unhindered by complicated structure
SPEAKER_58: and vocabulary.
SPEAKER_66: There is a rule of proximity that advises writers
SPEAKER_01: to keep each clause next to the subject to which it refers.
SPEAKER_04: Consider this confusing sentence.
SPEAKER_08: Fast bikes are an obsession of many men,
SPEAKER_20: some with speeds exceeding 200 miles per hour.
SPEAKER_62: You might be forgiven for wondering
SPEAKER_88: whether the bikes are racing this fast
SPEAKER_38: or the man can run its superhuman speed.
SPEAKER_73: The sentences make clearer by moving the clause
SPEAKER_29: next to its subject, the bikes.
SPEAKER_20: Fast bikes, some with speeds exceeding 200 miles per hour,
SPEAKER_08: are an obsession of many men.
SPEAKER_54: Most readers will guess what the writer of the first sentence
SPEAKER_11: is trying to say,
SPEAKER_43: but the clarity of the second sentence means
SPEAKER_78: that the reader will not have to make this judgment call.
SPEAKER_55: It might seem a little eccentric,
SPEAKER_16: but reviewing your work by reading it aloud
SPEAKER_86: can help to identify the williest areas.
SPEAKER_13: This works best if you perform your reading in a theatrical way,
SPEAKER_38: pausing at the commas and ends of sentences.
SPEAKER_49: If you run out of breath-jarring a sentence,
SPEAKER_03: it is probably too long.
SPEAKER_83: You ought to be able to convert your writing
SPEAKER_52: into a speech in this way.
SPEAKER_53: If it sounds too stilted and convoluted,
SPEAKER_25: perhaps you could rework these parts
SPEAKER_11: until they sound fluid.
SPEAKER_08: Cutting back the number of words in your sentence
SPEAKER_15: can also make it more comprehensible.
SPEAKER_06: Think about the value of each word in this sentence.
SPEAKER_81: It should be appreciated that Charles Dickens
SPEAKER_77: was not actually a Londoner by birth.
SPEAKER_44: After removing the beginning and the word actually,
SPEAKER_04: the same information is conveyed by the shorter sentence.
SPEAKER_01: Charles Dickens was not a Londoner by birth.
SPEAKER_22: I remember that word should earn their keep,
SPEAKER_12: so make sure that each one has a purpose.
SPEAKER_12: This should make your writing tighter and easier to read.
SPEAKER_24: It's unlikely that your reader will be fooled
SPEAKER_80: by the idea that long words make you sound clever.
SPEAKER_03: Cluttering your sentence with too many complicated words
SPEAKER_15: can prevent its meaning from being understood at all.
SPEAKER_01: A short word is always preferable to a long one.
SPEAKER_17: Why should anyone choose the word erroneous
SPEAKER_82: over the word wrong in an essay?
SPEAKER_41: Usually writers who employ more obscure words
SPEAKER_68: are trying to sound impressive but can appear pretentious.
SPEAKER_17: Direct words enable you to control what you are saying
SPEAKER_21: and are not necessarily babyish
SPEAKER_01: but are the most appropriate ones for the job.
SPEAKER_10: When you read your writing aloud,
SPEAKER_28: you will notice the key stress comes at the end of your sentence.
SPEAKER_28: It is therefore most effective to end with a short
SPEAKER_56: and emphatic word to secure your point.
SPEAKER_09: Try to resist the impulse to waffle at the end of your sentence
SPEAKER_39: by trailing off into qualifying clauses.
SPEAKER_60: It might be worth relocating the clause
SPEAKER_40: to the beginning of the sentence
SPEAKER_32: or losing it altogether if you feel that it adds little to its meaning.
SPEAKER_02: Your sentences might be the most grammatically perfect in the world
SPEAKER_16: but still cause your writing to sound wrong
SPEAKER_85: if you have misjudged its tone.
SPEAKER_69: A colloquial style which uses slang and exclamation
SPEAKER_02: is an inappropriately chatti tone for an essay.
SPEAKER_13: However, style can be equally jarring
SPEAKER_25: if your vocabulary is too formal or ambitious for its context.
SPEAKER_78: It is much more impressive to make complicated points
SPEAKER_37: using simple language and grammar.
SPEAKER_27: Although these ways of organising your thoughts
SPEAKER_72: and writing are straightforward,
SPEAKER_26: if you don't get it right first time then work on your piece,
SPEAKER_42: it is often the act of juggling and tidying
SPEAKER_35: that really transforms writing.
SPEAKER_00: Starting with the subject, using direct words
SPEAKER_29: and keeping sentences short are the most compelling way of writing.
SPEAKER_00: The confident right to it is someone who remembers
SPEAKER_64: how simple these traits can be.
SPEAKER_06: We hope this basic introduction to writing techniques has been useful.
SPEAKER_70: If you want to develop your skills further,
SPEAKER_19: ask your bookseller for a copy of right at right
SPEAKER_26: by John Peck and Martin Coil,
SPEAKER_31: published by Paul Grave McMillan.
