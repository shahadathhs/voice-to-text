SPEAKER_00: The secret to writing a great sentence is keeping it simple.
SPEAKER_00: Many people imagine that good writers use words in a complicated way, but the tricks of
SPEAKER_00: the trade are all about making your writing easy to read.
SPEAKER_00: This audio explores some straightforward methods of constructing your writing in a clear,
SPEAKER_00: engaging manner and conveying your meaning as directly as possible.
SPEAKER_00: The best writers start paragraphs snappily.
SPEAKER_00: It is a good idea to begin your piece of writing with this simple, one statement sentence
SPEAKER_00: to emphasise the substance of what you are trying to say.
SPEAKER_00: If you can think of a provocative or unusual proposal, it will grab the reader's attention
SPEAKER_00: to open your piece with this idea.
SPEAKER_00: You should always start your sentence with its subject to make the maximum impact on your
SPEAKER_00: reader.
SPEAKER_00: Consider these two examples.
SPEAKER_00: A deeply conservative attitude has always been characteristic of the Labour Party.
SPEAKER_00: The Labour Party has always been deeply conservative.
SPEAKER_00: Many students might opt for the first sentence thinking it sounds more mature, but its structure
SPEAKER_00: is back to front.
SPEAKER_00: The second sentence makes its point much more quickly and succinctly.
SPEAKER_00: You might want to vary the beginning of your sentences with an opening clause, but
SPEAKER_00: generally speaking, you can and should put your subject first throughout your paragraph.
SPEAKER_00: Keeping your sentence untangled can be a nightmare, especially if your thinking is muddled in
SPEAKER_00: the first place.
SPEAKER_00: Try dividing your thoughts into separate capsules of single ideas, restricting yourself to one
SPEAKER_00: idea capsule per sentence.
SPEAKER_00: When your sentence becomes too long, it is sensible to break it up into more sentences
SPEAKER_00: with fewer clauses.
SPEAKER_00: No sentence should contain more than three clauses, since the sides distract the reader from
SPEAKER_00: the original point.
SPEAKER_00: Single clause sentences are the most effective at focusing attention.
SPEAKER_00: You could consider it unfair on your reader if he or she has to search for meaning in your
SPEAKER_00: writing.
SPEAKER_00: Concerning with the reader will be at its best if your style is unhindered by complicated
SPEAKER_00: structure and vocabulary.
SPEAKER_00: There is a rule of proximity that advises writers to keep each clause next to the subject
SPEAKER_00: to which it refers.
SPEAKER_00: Consider this confusing sentence.
SPEAKER_00: Fast bikes are an obsession of many men, some with speeds exceeding 200 miles per hour.
SPEAKER_00: You might be forgiven for wondering whether the bikes are aching this fast or the man
SPEAKER_00: can run at superhuman speed.
SPEAKER_00: The sentences make clearer by moving the clause next to its subject, the bikes.
SPEAKER_00: Fast bikes, some with speeds exceeding 200 miles per hour, are an obsession of many men.
SPEAKER_00: Most readers will guess what the writer of the first sentence is trying to say, for
SPEAKER_00: the clarity of the second sentence means that the reader will not have to make this judgment
SPEAKER_00: call.
SPEAKER_00: It might seem a little eccentric, but reviewing your work by reading it aloud can help to identify
SPEAKER_00: the williest areas.
SPEAKER_00: This works best if you perform your reading in a theatrical way, pausing at the commas
SPEAKER_00: and ends of sentences.
SPEAKER_00: If you run out of breath-jang a sentence, it is probably too long.
SPEAKER_00: You ought to be able to convert your writing into a speech in this way.
SPEAKER_00: If it sounds too stilted and convoluted, perhaps you could rework these parts until they
SPEAKER_00: sound fluid.
SPEAKER_00: Cuzzing back the number of words in your sentence can also make it more comprehensible.
SPEAKER_00: Think about the value of each word in this sentence.
SPEAKER_00: It should be appreciated that Charles Dickens was not actually a Londoner by birth.
SPEAKER_00: After removing the beginning and the word actually, the same information is conveyed by the
SPEAKER_00: shorter sentence, Charles Dickens was not a Londoner by birth.
SPEAKER_00: Remember that word should earn their keep, so make sure that each one has a purpose.
SPEAKER_00: This should make your writing tighter and easier to read.
SPEAKER_00: It's unlikely that your reader will be fooled by the idea that long words make you sound
SPEAKER_00: clever.
SPEAKER_00: Cluttering your sentence with too many complicated words can prevent its meaning from being
SPEAKER_00: understood at all.
SPEAKER_00: A short word is always preferable to a long one.
SPEAKER_00: Why should anyone choose the word erroneous over the word wrong in an essay?
SPEAKER_00: Usually writers who employ more obscure words are trying to sound impressive but can
SPEAKER_00: appear pretentious.
SPEAKER_00: Direct words enable you to control what you are saying and are not necessarily babyish
SPEAKER_00: but are the most appropriate ones for the job.
SPEAKER_00: When you read your writing aloud, you will notice the key stress comes at the end of your
SPEAKER_00: sentence.
SPEAKER_00: It is therefore most effective to end with a short and emphatic word to secure your
SPEAKER_00: point.
SPEAKER_00: Try to resist the impulse to waffle at the end of your sentence by trailing off into qualifying
SPEAKER_00: clauses.
SPEAKER_00: It might be worth relocating the clause to the beginning of the sentence or losing it
SPEAKER_00: altogether if you feel that it adds little to its meaning.
SPEAKER_00: Your sentences might be the most grammatically perfect in the world but still cause your
SPEAKER_00: writing to sound wrong if you have misjudged its tone.
SPEAKER_00: A colloquial style which uses slang and exclamation is an inappropriately chatti tone for an essay.
SPEAKER_00: However, style can be equally jarring if your vocabulary is too formal or ambitious for
SPEAKER_00: its context.
SPEAKER_00: It is much more impressive to make complicated points using simple language and grammar.
SPEAKER_00: Although these ways of organising your thoughts into writing are straightforward, if you don't
SPEAKER_00: get it right first time then work on your piece.
SPEAKER_00: It is often the act of juggling and tidying that really transforms writing.
SPEAKER_00: Starting with the subject, using direct words and keeping sentences short are the most compelling
SPEAKER_00: way of writing.
SPEAKER_00: The confident writer is someone who remembers how simple these tricks can be.
SPEAKER_00: We hope this basic introduction to writing techniques has been useful.
SPEAKER_00: If you want to develop your skills further, ask your bookseller for a copy of Write
SPEAKER_00: It Right by John Peck and Martin Coil, published by Paul Grave McMillan.
