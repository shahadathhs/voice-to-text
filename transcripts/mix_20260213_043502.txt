SPEAKER_00: The Secret to Write To The Great Sentence
SPEAKER_00: Today, we will talk about a very interesting story
SPEAKER_00: that people say is a very interesting story.
SPEAKER_00: But I think it's a good story.
SPEAKER_00: It's a very interesting story that people want to watch.
SPEAKER_00: But I don't think it's too hard to find.
SPEAKER_00: The story changes my own story.
SPEAKER_00: I feel that I'm not a good person.
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to be with the person or the person who is willing to be the best.
SPEAKER_00: It's true.
SPEAKER_00: But I think it's a good story.
SPEAKER_00: If you want to be a very cool person,
SPEAKER_00: then you should be a good person.
SPEAKER_00: This story will be okay.
SPEAKER_00: It's not that the best way to get involved.
SPEAKER_00: The problem is that there are people who don't have a job
SPEAKER_00: or have a hard time.
SPEAKER_00: The problem is that the trend is not the same.
SPEAKER_00: But this is not a fan.
SPEAKER_00: And the story is that the person who is beautiful or handsome is just the same.
SPEAKER_00: This story is true.
SPEAKER_00: The reason why the person is so good at it,
SPEAKER_00: is that the person who is willing to be the best.
SPEAKER_00: It's not that he has to be a good person.
SPEAKER_00: Or that he has to be a good person.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I think the truth is that the person who is willing to be his own,
SPEAKER_00: can be his own.
SPEAKER_00: And if there is a way to get involved,
SPEAKER_00: everyone has their own happiness.
SPEAKER_00: The truth is that you can't be a good person.
SPEAKER_00: You're so beautiful.
SPEAKER_00: You're so beautiful.
SPEAKER_00: You're so beautiful.
SPEAKER_00: But if you don't have a hard time,
SPEAKER_00: you have to be a good person.
SPEAKER_00: And this is what we want to show everyone
SPEAKER_00: that we have tried to come back to the past.
SPEAKER_00: We will meet in the future.
SPEAKER_00: It's true to yourself to one idea, capsule per sentence.
SPEAKER_00: When your sentence becomes too long,
SPEAKER_00: it is sensible to break it up into more sentences with fewer clauses.
SPEAKER_00: No sentence should contain more than three clauses,
SPEAKER_00: since the sides distract the reader from the original point.
SPEAKER_00: Single clause sentences are the most effective at focusing attention.
SPEAKER_00: You could consider it unfair on your reader
SPEAKER_00: if he or she has to search for meaning in your writing.
SPEAKER_00: Communication with the reader will be at its best
SPEAKER_00: if your style is unhindered by complicated structure and vocabulary.
SPEAKER_00: There is a rule of proximity that advises writers
SPEAKER_00: to keep each clause next to the subject to which it refers.
SPEAKER_00: Consider this confusing sentence.
SPEAKER_00: Fast bikes are an obsession of many men,
SPEAKER_00: some with speeds exceeding 200 miles per hour.
SPEAKER_00: You might be forgiven for wondering whether the bikes are aching this fast
SPEAKER_00: or the man can run its superhuman speed.
SPEAKER_00: The sentences make clearer by moving the clause next to its subject, the bikes.
SPEAKER_00: Fast bikes, some with speeds exceeding 200 miles per hour,
SPEAKER_00: are an obsession of many men.
SPEAKER_00: Most readers will guess what the writer of the first sentence is trying to say,
SPEAKER_00: but the clarity of the second sentence means that the reader
SPEAKER_00: will not have to make this judgment call.
SPEAKER_00: It might seem a little eccentric,
SPEAKER_00: but reviewing your work by reading it aloud can help to identify the williest areas.
SPEAKER_00: This works best if you perform your reading in a theatrical way,
SPEAKER_00: pausing at the commas and ends of sentences.
SPEAKER_00: If you run out of breath-jarring a sentence, it is probably too long.
SPEAKER_00: You ought to be able to convert your writing into a speech in this way.
SPEAKER_00: If it sounds too stilted and convoluted,
SPEAKER_00: perhaps you could rework these parts until they sound fluid.
SPEAKER_00: Cutting back the number of words in your sentence can also make it more comprehensible.
SPEAKER_00: Think about the value of each word in this sentence.
SPEAKER_00: It should be appreciated that Charles Dickens was not actually a Londoner by birth.
SPEAKER_00: After removing the beginning and the word actually,
SPEAKER_00: the same information is conveyed by the shorter sentence.
SPEAKER_00: Charles Dickens was not a Londoner by birth.
SPEAKER_00: I remember that word should earn their keep,
SPEAKER_00: so make sure that each one has a purpose.
SPEAKER_00: This should make your writing tighter and easier to read.
SPEAKER_00: It's unlikely that your reader will be fooled by the idea that long words make you sound clever.
SPEAKER_00: Cluttering your sentence with too many complicated words can prevent its meaning from being understood at all.
SPEAKER_00: A short word is always preferable to a long one.
SPEAKER_00: Why should anyone choose the word erroneous over the word wrong in an essay?
SPEAKER_00: Usually writers who employ more obscure words are trying to sound impressive but can appear pretentious.
SPEAKER_00: Direct words enable you to control what you are saying and are not necessarily baby-ish,
SPEAKER_00: but are the most appropriate ones for the job.
SPEAKER_00: When you read your writing aloud, you will notice the key stress comes at the end of your sentence.
SPEAKER_00: It is therefore most effective to end with a short and emphatic word to secure your point.
SPEAKER_00: Try to resist the impulse to waffle at the end of your sentence by trailing off into qualifying closures.
SPEAKER_00: It might be worth relocating the clause to the beginning of the sentence or losing it altogether if you feel that it adds little to its meaning.
SPEAKER_00: Your sentences might be the most grammatically perfect in the world, but still cause your writing to sound wrong if you have misjudged tone.
SPEAKER_00: A colloquial style which uses slang and exclamation is an inappropriately chatty tone for an essay.
SPEAKER_00: However, style can be equally jarring if your vocabulary is too formal or ambitious for its context.
SPEAKER_00: It is much more impressive to make complicated points using simple language and grammar.
SPEAKER_00: Although these ways of organising your thoughts into writing are straightforward, if you don't get it right first time, then work on your piece.
SPEAKER_00: It is often the act of juggling and tidying that really transforms writing.
SPEAKER_00: Starting with the subject, using direct words and keeping sentences short are the most compelling way of writing.
SPEAKER_00: The confident writer is someone who remembers how simple these tricks can be.
SPEAKER_00: We hope this basic introduction to writing techniques has been useful.
